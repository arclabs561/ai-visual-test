# NPM Publish Review

## Package Information

- **Name**: `@vllm-testing/core`
- **Version**: `0.1.0`
- **Repository**: `https://github.com/arclabs561/vllm-testing.git`
- **License**: MIT (needs to be added)

## Pre-Publish Checklist

### ✅ Ready
- [x] Package name is scoped (`@vllm-testing/core`)
- [x] Version is set (`0.1.0`)
- [x] Repository URL is correct
- [x] Main entry point is set (`src/index.mjs`)
- [x] Exports are configured
- [x] Files list includes necessary files
- [x] README.md exists
- [x] CHANGELOG.md exists
- [x] Type is set to `module` (ES Modules)

### ⚠️ Needs Attention

1. **LICENSE file missing**
   - npm requires a LICENSE file
   - Add `LICENSE` file with MIT license text

2. **Author field empty**
   - Consider adding author information
   - Format: `"author": "Your Name <email@example.com>"`

3. **No .npmignore**
   - Currently using `files` field (good)
   - Consider adding `.npmignore` for clarity

4. **Not logged into npm**
   - Need to run `npm login` before publishing
   - Need npm account with access to `@vllm-testing` scope

5. **Scope ownership**
   - Need to verify ownership of `@vllm-testing` scope
   - Or use unscoped name like `vllm-testing-core`

## Files to Include

Current `files` field includes:
- ✅ `src/**/*.mjs` - Source files
- ✅ `api/**/*.js` - API routes (for Vercel deployment)
- ✅ `public/**/*.html` - Public files (for Vercel deployment)
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Vercel config (for deployment)
- ✅ `README.md` - Documentation
- ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- ✅ `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guide
- ✅ `example.test.mjs` - Example usage

**Note**: `api/`, `public/`, and `vercel.json` are for Vercel deployment, not needed for npm package. Consider:
- Option A: Keep them (package can be deployed as service)
- Option B: Remove them (package is library only)

## Publishing Steps

### 1. Create LICENSE file
```bash
# Create MIT LICENSE file
cat > LICENSE << 'EOF'

```

### 2. Update package.json
```json
{
  "author": "Your Name <email@example.com>",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

### 3. Login to npm
```bash
npm login
```

### 4. Verify scope access
```bash
npm whoami
# Check if you have access to @vllm-testing scope
```

### 5. Publish
```bash
# Dry run first
npm publish --dry-run

# Publish as private (recommended)
npm publish --access private

# Or publish as public
npm publish --access public
```

## Recommendations

### For Library Use Only
If this is only a library (not a deployable service):
- Remove `api/`, `public/`, `vercel.json` from `files`
- Focus on `src/**/*.mjs` and documentation

### For Library + Service
If you want both:
- Keep current `files` configuration
- Document that it can be used as library or deployed as service
- Consider separate packages: `@vllm-testing/core` (library) and `@vllm-testing/service` (deployment)

### Scope Name
- Current: `@vllm-testing/core`
- Alternative: `vllm-testing-core` (unscoped, easier to publish)
- Check if `@vllm-testing` scope exists or needs to be created

## Current Status

✅ **Package structure**: Good
✅ **Exports**: Configured correctly
✅ **Documentation**: README and CHANGELOG exist
⚠️ **LICENSE**: Missing
⚠️ **Author**: Empty
⚠️ **npm login**: Not verified
⚠️ **Scope access**: Not verified

## Next Steps

1. Add LICENSE file
2. Add author to package.json
3. Login to npm: `npm login`
4. Verify scope access
5. Test publish: `npm publish --dry-run`
6. Publish: `npm publish --access private`
