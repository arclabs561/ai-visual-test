# Expert Evaluation Guide: Applying Temporal Decision-Making to Complex Websites

## Overview

This guide shows how to apply temporal decision-making to evaluate complex, opinionated websites with expert-level considerations.

## Key Features

### 1. Expert-Level Evaluation

Evaluates subtle, opinionated details that experts notice:
- Typography hierarchy and rhythm
- Color theory and palette harmony
- Information architecture
- Micro-interactions and feedback
- Accessibility beyond WCAG minimums
- Performance perception
- Brand consistency
- Content strategy

### 2. Temporal Decision-Making Integration

Uses all temporal components:
- **humanPerceptionTime**: Models expert attention and evaluation time
- **SequentialDecisionContext**: Maintains consistency across evaluations
- **aggregateMultiScale**: Analyzes at multiple time scales
- **TemporalBatchOptimizer**: Handles complex evaluation workflows

### 3. Persona-Based Expert Evaluation

Tests from different expert perspectives:
- Typography Expert
- Color Theory Expert
- Information Architecture Expert
- Accessibility Expert
- Performance Expert
- Brand Strategist

## Usage

### Basic Expert Evaluation

```javascript
import { evaluateExpertScenarios } from '../utils/expert-evaluation-scenarios.mjs';

const results = await evaluateExpertScenarios();
// Evaluates 8 expert websites with temporal decision-making
```

### Expert Persona Evaluation

```javascript
import { evaluateWithExpertPersonas } from '../utils/expert-persona-evaluation.mjs';

const results = await evaluateWithExpertPersonas();
// Evaluates websites from 6 expert persona perspectives
```

## Expert Criteria Examples

### Typography Expert

**Main Criteria:**
- Clear visual hierarchy with consistent scale
- Vertical rhythm and spacing harmony
- Font pairing creates visual interest without conflict
- Optimal line length and leading for reading

**Subtle Considerations:**
- Baseline grid alignment
- Optical sizing adjustments
- Contextual alternates usage
- Ligature quality

### Color Theory Expert

**Main Criteria:**
- Color palette creates visual harmony
- Sufficient contrast while maintaining aesthetic
- Color-blind friendly while beautiful
- Colors support brand and content goals

**Subtle Considerations:**
- Color temperature consistency
- Saturation balance
- Value distribution
- Color context sensitivity

## Temporal Analysis

### Multi-Scale Aggregation

Evaluates at different time scales:
- **Immediate (0.1s)**: First impression, instant reactions
- **Short (1s)**: Quick assessment, initial evaluation
- **Medium (10s)**: Detailed analysis, comprehensive review
- **Long (60s)**: Deep evaluation, expert critique

### Sequential Context

Maintains consistency across evaluations:
- Tracks evaluation history
- Adapts prompts based on patterns
- Identifies recurring issues
- Ensures consistent scoring

## Results

Results include:
- Expert-level scores (0-10)
- Detailed reasoning from expert perspective
- Specific issues and strengths
- Recommendations for improvement
- Temporal analysis at multiple scales
- Sequential context patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Run Expert Evaluations**: Test on target websites
2. **Analyze Results**: Review expert-level insights
3. **Compare Temporal Scales**: Understand different time perspectives
4. **Use Sequential Context**: Track consistency across evaluations
5. **Apply Personas**: Test from multiple expert perspectives

## Real-World Application

This approach is useful for:
- Design system evaluation
- Accessibility audits
- Performance optimization
- Brand consistency checks
- Content strategy validation
- Expert-level quality assurance
