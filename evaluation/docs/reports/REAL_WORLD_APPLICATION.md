## Implementation

### Using Expert Evaluation Scenarios

```javascript
import { evaluateExpertScenarios } from '../../utils/expert-evaluation-scenarios.mjs';

const results = await evaluateExpertScenarios();
// Results include expert-level evaluations with temporal analysis
```

### Using Expert Persona Evaluation

```javascript
import { evaluateWithExpertPersonas } from '../../utils/expert-persona-evaluation.mjs';

const results = await evaluateWithExpertPersonas();
// Results include persona-based expert evaluations with multi-scale temporal aggregation
```

## Benefits

1. **Expert-Level Insights**: Evaluates subtle, opinionated details experts notice
2. **Temporal Analysis**: Uses multi-scale temporal aggregation for comprehensive evaluation
3. **Sequential Context**: Maintains context across evaluations for consistency
4. **Persona-Based**: Tests from different expert perspectives
5. **Real-World Application**: Applies to complex, production websites

## Next Steps

1. Run expert evaluation scenarios on target websites
2. Analyze results for expert-level insights
3. Compare temporal scales for different evaluation aspects
4. Use sequential context for consistency tracking
5. Apply persona-based evaluation for multi-perspective analysis
