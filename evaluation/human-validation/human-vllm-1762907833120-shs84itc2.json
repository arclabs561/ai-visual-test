    "**Visibility of Game Elements:** Zero. No characters, UI, environment, lyrics, or scores are visible.",
    "**Clarity and Readability:** The frame is completely blank, offering no content to interpret.",
    "**Engagement:** There is no visual content to engage the player.",
    "**Contextual Relevance (queeraoke-reactive-gameplay):** Without any visual cues, it's impossible to tell if this is a deliberate effect (like a flash or fade to white), a loading screen, or an error state where the game failed to render. If it's meant to be a moment of active gameplay, it represents a critical failure in visual feedback.",
    "*Overall:** As a gameplay frame, this image is uninformative and suggests either a temporary visual effect (like a very brief flash or transition) or a problem with the game's rendering or display. It does not convey any active gameplay."
