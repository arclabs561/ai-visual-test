  "humanIssues": [
    "**Visual appearance:** It's just a big white box with a title and \"Score: 0\" at the bottom. There's absolutely nothing happening visually. No characters, no background, no action, no colors, no exciting elements. It looks incredibly bland and empty. This is the opposite of fun or engaging. It feels like I've opened a blank document, not a game.",
    "**Code correctness (from my perspective):** I don't really care about the technical code details, but if the code is supposed to make a game appear, it's clearly not doing its job. The fact that the \"rendered code analysis\" shows an empty structure for the game content confirms what I see: nothing. The `body` might be styled, but if there's nothing *in* the body, there's no game.",
    "**State consistency:** This is where it gets really confusing and frustrating. The game state says I'm on `level: 1`, have `score: 100`, `lives: 3`, and `gameActive: true`. But on my screen, it clearly says \"Score: 0,\" and I don't see anything about my level or lives. If the game is \"active,\" why is the screen completely blank? This inconsistency is a huge turn-off. It makes me think the game is broken or not loaded correctly, which immediately kills any potential enjoyment.",
    "**Principles alignment (fun, enjoyment):** This state completely fails to align with my goals.",
    "**Fun:** There is absolutely no fun to be had here. It's a blank screen.",
    "**Enjoyment:** Zero enjoyment. I can't interact with anything, there's nothing to look at, and the information displayed is wrong.",
    "**Engagement:** There's nothing to engage with. I'd probably close this tab within seconds.",
    "*Overall Evaluation:**",
    "From a casual gamer's perspective, this is a nonstarter. It's not a game; it's an empty canvas with conflicting information. I'm looking for something to jump into and enjoy, even if it's simple. This offers no visual appeal, no interaction, and confusing feedback. I'd move on to another game immediately because this one provides no fun or enjoyment whatsoever. It needs actual game elements, correct score display, and some indication that a game is indeed \"active\" to even begin to be considered a game."
